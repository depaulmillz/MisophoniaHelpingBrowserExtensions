# Browser Extensions For Misophonia

I created this repository after a friend wanted me to help with preventing issues with misophonia while watching Netflix.
The browser extensions are designed to target whistling and cheering sounds which are painful noises to my friend.
Currently the extensions target the painful noises by reading the subtitles which must be enabled during the Netflix watching
experience.
